BinaryBuilder is used to compile non-Julia dependencies for use in Julia packages, and as such provides C/C++/Fortran/Rust/Go cross-compilers that target all platforms that Julia itself runs on.  BinaryBuilder provides a fast, convenient and reliable method to build these dependencies and ship them to the hundreds of thousands of Julia users worldwide, with minimal pain.  The <a href="https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil">Yggdrasil</a> community build tree contains thousands of recipes authored by hundreds of community members, building everything from numerical libraries, to portable graphics stacks, to CUDA runtimes and drivers.

              <p>I designed and implemented a library for switching the backing BLAS/LAPACK library for Julia (and other projects that need the same behavior).  This library abstracts away ABI differences in different vendor libraries (such as OpenBLAS, Apple Accelerate, Intel MKL, Fujitsu BLAS, and more) through calling convention trickery and some hand-written assembly.  Design requirements of this library were to be low-overhead, interoperable with both C and Fortran dependencies, and to work on all operating systems and architectures that Julia itself works on.</p>

Our rebuild was necessary to provide a high-performance, GPU P2P-enabled stack for use in running realtime, full-duplex machine learning workloads on sample streams from the software-defined radio.  Our eventual models were able to perform blind adaptive beamforming with an uncalibrated array, as described in <a href="papers/BlindSeparationWithML_Array2022.pdf">our paper published in Array 2022</a>.</p>

We are able to provide region-specific downloads at a fraction of the price and at lower latency than that of a naive S3-based implementation.

              <p>My Ph.D. dissertation, titled <a href="papers/ElliotSaba_Dissertation.pdf">Techniques for Cough Sound Analysis</a>, developed tools for detecting and processing cough sounds.  I developed deep learning models to extract information about coughs from audio streams in real time on resource-constrained hardware, and compared the learning systems' performance against domain-specific signal processing tools.  The result was a best-in-class cough detector and tuberculosis cough sound discriminator.  Training the deep learning model in the presence of confounding signals is also addressed, resulting in the development of a discriminative adversarial network to filter out information that the model should not take into account.</p>
